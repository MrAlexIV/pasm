PASM is a timber company that uses an Optimisation Algorithm to figure out how to optimise its profits.
In particular, through the Simulated Annealing algorithm (using MATLAB), the production choice is optimised by understanding what is worth producing and in what quantity. Obviously taking into account several factors, such as customer demand, production constraints, energy costs... Then, through an LSTM network, an attempt is made to predict future costs in order to have a better overview of what will happen.
